# Experiment Log

Keep one section per meeting. Add the tables and plots you make from
`runs/*/results.json` and `test-results.json` (save the plots in `evidence/`),
link the pools' contact sheets, and explain what you see. A result that shows no
effect is still a result: say so and say why.

## Meeting 1 — Real-data baselines

- **Question:** How much do oversampling and ordinary augmentation help Egyptian
  Mau recall compared with the imbalanced data?
- **How `oversample()` works:**
- **How `augment()` works, and why these transforms:**
- **Commands:**
- **Results on validation:** (your table and plot)
- **What I see:**
- **Test results of the three baselines:**

## Meeting 2 — Text-to-image generation

- **Question:**
- **Setting changed in each pool (one at a time):**
- **Commands:**
- **Contact sheets:** (good and bad images, with the failure types you name)
- **Results on validation:** (table and plot)
- **What I see:**
- **Pool I take forward, and why:**
- **Its test result, compared with the baselines:**

## Meeting 3 — Generation from training photos

- **Question:** How close to the real photos should the synthetic images be?
- **img2img strength values and IP-Adapter scale values tried:**
- **Commands:**
- **Contact sheets:**
- **Results on validation:**
- **What I see:**
- **Best run of each mode, and its test result:**

## Meeting 4 — Editing training photos

- **Question:** Does the classifier need new cats or new backgrounds?
- **Background prompts and outpainting scales tried:**
- **Commands:**
- **Contact sheets:**
- **Results on validation:**
- **What I see:**
- **Best run of each mode, and its test result:**

## Final comparison

- **Runs chosen in Meetings 1–4:**
- **Results:** (your table and plot of their `test-results.json`)
- **Did the validation ranking hold on the test photos?**
- **Recommendation:** use, revise, or reject synthetic data for this task.
